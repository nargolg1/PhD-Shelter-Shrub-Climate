###Questions for Shelter Project
#1. To what extent does the natural fabric burlap affect microclimatic parameters such as relative humidity (RH), temperature, and light intensity under the shelter canopy in the winter? 
#2. Is there a significant difference in the above measurements for differently-shaped shelters? 
#3. Is there a difference in how the shelters affect the above parameters at a southern, dry site versus  milder sites in the north?
#4. Is the variation significant between climatic measurements taken using data loggers and versus a handheld device?
#5. How do natural shrubs compare to artificial shetlers in terms of impacting the canopy microclimate?
  
###Questions for shrub handheld experiment. 
#1. How does shrub size influence canopy temperature and humidity?
#2. How do logger recording compare to handheld recordings?
#3. How does microclimate of shrubs differ in northern sites versus southern sites?

###Sample datasheets
library(tidyverse)

#location of shelters and shrub
df1<-read.csv("C:/Users/Nargol Ghazian/Desktop/PhD-Shelter-Shrub-Climate/Field Season 2023/Shelters and shrubs.csv") 
knitr::kable(df1)

     
#microclimate handheld shelters and shrubs
df2<-read.csv("C:/Users/Nargol Ghazian/Desktop/PhD-Shelter-Shrub-Climate/Field Season 2023/handheld_climate.csv")
knitr::kable(df2)

#microclimate at shrub gradient
df3<- read.csv("C:/Users/Nargol Ghazian/Desktop/PhD-Shelter-Shrub-Climate/Field Season 2023/shrub xyz and microclimate.csv")
knitr::kable(df3)

###methods

##shelters
#1. Build 4 shelters in total (2 square, 2 triangle)in Carrizo sites 3 and 4 and pair with 2 shrubs. Do the same in Tecopa. Do the same in soda_lake open and Tecopa_open.
#2. Put hobo and omega loggers underneath all and the shrubs and shelters.
#3. Measure handheld climate data twice.

##shrub size experiment
#1. Measure handheld climate at 30 shrubs and opens at Carrizo 3,4, Cuyama 1,2,3,4, Semitropics and Tecopa_shrub. This is called MSAT (Mean Surface Air Temp)
#3. Do point measurements using a laser pointer at shrub and open.
#4. Measure shrub x, y, and Z.

###Big picture

#1. Have winter data in case refree asks what if shelters only cool when it is super dry and hot.

#2. One more paper for shrub gradient size and microclimate.
