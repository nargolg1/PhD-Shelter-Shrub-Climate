Chris' edit notes

You said you wanted to try MEE first with the cam trap meta right?
Did you check the journal?
This paper was out and is not cited in ours.

An empirical evaluation of camera trap study design: How many, how long and when?

https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13370

it is NOT a meta BUT it must be cited and is a very strong data synthesis and I think you need
 to read and think over.

fig 2  - ok
fig 3 - I think we are ok - detection rate..... I 'think' the same as what we have etc..

there are also another 123 paper on cam traps.
Looks like you cited only one.

SO add a few more please.
plus chew on this paper that is kind of identical BUT used very different data.

could go EITHER way for us now - I think PRO - ie we did a meta, then used emammal etc..

SO I think we are GOOD - just need to majorly work it into ours - right in the intro.
